# Changelog

## 1.0.4

- Add support for controller in the TextField

## 1.0.3

- Fix an issue where calling `Navigator.pop` methods inside `onSubmitted` would cause a NPE and throw a really gnarly error that doesn't even print to console.

## 1.0.2

- Fix an issue where a null backgroundColor in appBar caused a white back button. Also, change to `flutter_search_bar` because I'm a genius and locked myself out of `search_bar` until I buy gapps for `spencer@frozor.io`.

## 1.0.1

- Compile documentation, whoops.

## 1.0.0

- Initial version
